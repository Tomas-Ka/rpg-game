# Python RPG game!
This is my feeble attemts at making some sort of simple RPG game just for fun during my programming classes.
If everything goes to plan I might even add multiplayer to it, and that plan is basically just to have a movable character with some actions and some sort of tileable background.


If you're interested in where I got the project (and all the art for that matter), I am following parts of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw) guide, and used the [Ninja adventure pack by Pixel Boy and AAA](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack)
